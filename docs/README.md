# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome! This README provides a summary of OctoAcme's project management processes and quick access links to each document.

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme uses a structured, iterative approach to deliver product features, services, and integrations. Our processes cover end-to-end project lifecycle management, grounded in these core principles:

- **Customer-first:** Prioritize customer value and usability
- **Iterative delivery:** Deliver small, testable increments
- **Clear ownership:** Each project has named leadership with defined responsibilities
- **Data-informed decisions:** Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety:** Encourage feedback and continuous learning

### Process Overview

Our project lifecycle spans eight key stages, each documented in detail:

1. **[Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md)** — Core principles, roles, artifacts, and the high-level project lifecycle
2. **[Project Initiation](octoacme-project-initiation.md)** — Validating new projects, defining business needs, and launching authorized work
3. **[Project Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md)** — Breaking work into shippable increments, identifying dependencies, and creating actionable backlogs
4. **[Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)** — Daily team rhythms, PR workflows, quality practices, escalation paths, and progress reporting
5. **[Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)** — Identifying and mitigating risks, managing dependencies, and communicating with stakeholders
6. **[Release & Deployment](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)** — Standardized processes for releasing features and responding to incidents
7. **[Retrospective & Continuous Improvement](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)** — Capturing learnings and converting them into actionable improvements
8. **[Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)** — Reference guide for role responsibilities and typical interactions
